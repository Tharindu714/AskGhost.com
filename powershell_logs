√ Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select features, then Enter to
confirm your choices. Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory and its files, Hosting: Configure files for
Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

√ Please select an option: Use an existing project

i  Using project ghost-incidents-bot (ghost-incidents-bot)
√ What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? TypeScript
√ Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? Yes
+  Wrote functions/package.json
+  Wrote functions/.eslintrc.js
+  Wrote functions/tsconfig.dev.json
